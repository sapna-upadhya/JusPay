Allow anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store.

JuzPay users need a way to easily transfer money or shop online without debit/ credit cards or physically visiting a bank.
Because of the evolving technology, people want to adapt to online payment methods that are easy, quick, and safe.

We will be able to provide users with an online payment app that is simple and convenient to use by providing an easy interface, simple navigation, important features such as to send/request/receive money, make online payments, quick payment at stores, view transaction history, and good customer service.
